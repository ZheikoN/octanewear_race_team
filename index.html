            Simracing has its roots all the way in 1983 with what is believed to be the first racing game called
            Chequered Flag by Psion on ZX Spectrum.
        <p>
            Throughout the years, simracing is becoming more and more serious and simracers across the whole world
            are competing in many different competitions. Simracing saw a massive boom during early 2020 as whole
            world was put under lockdown due to Covid19. With majority of the real life comeptitions being on hold,
            virtual racing took the lead and for the first time, fans could watch e-racing in their own TVs.

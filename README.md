### Known Bugs

- Some pages are receiving lower scores from Google Lighthouse for performance
- amiresponsive is showing overlapping elements on iphone device, yet google dev tools with showing the same phone shows this correctly. Tested on phone and was not able to replicate what amiresponsive shows.
- Youtube video playing on main screen is set to play in loop according to official Google.dev page, but this does not seem to work: https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters
- Parallax scrolling seems to not work on actual iPhone 11 properly - background pictures appears to be loading stretched - I was not able to replicate this behaviour in Google Chrome iPhone preview
- Titles in index.html are not being placed correctly in some ultrawide screens, will be reviewed in future iterations

## Future Learnings and features

-   In future, multiple style sheets to be used for each individual page where possible

-   Spend a bit more time in planning phase to clearly plan out the project. I have been learning a lot of new stuff on the fly while working on this project, this resulted in certain features discovered possible in mid-development and not accounted for when planning

-   More focus on idividual updates while commiting these more regularly

-   Keep testing and validations to the very last step - instead of re-validating throughout the process
